Requests for the REST API
-------------------------
- can be executed using any REST Client, for example 
  - POSTMAN which is available in the Chrome App Store. Be aware to add the headers to the request!
  - CURL which is a unix standard command line tool and should be available on any Linux/Mac machine

Objectives
----------
- Retrieve all Objectives:
    curl -H "Accept: application/json" -X GET http://scavenger-game.appspot.com/rest/objectives

- Create a new Objective:
    curl -H "Accept: application/json" -X POST --data "keyname=location10&title=<title>&info=<info>&latitude=39.9769214975&longitude=-110.185279856&owner=<owner>&otherConfirmedUsers=<otherConfirmedUsers>&activity=photo" http://scavenger-game.appspot.com/rest/objectives

Users
-----
- Objective id's are stored with each user as a list. So each User data record doesn't contain the full dataset of the objective, but only the id.

- Retrieve all Data from User with id 'us2':
    curl -H "Accept: application/json" -X GET http://scavenger-game.appspot.com/rest/users/us2

- Create a new User with id 'us2':
    curl -H "Accept: application/json" -X POST --data "userid=us2" http://scavenger-game.appspot.com/rest/users

- Add a Objective of Type 'visualObjective' to a User 'us2', provided the keyname of a existing objective:
    curl -H "Accept: application/json" -X POST --data "objectiveType=visualObjective&objectiveId=location101456300906241" http://scavenger-game.appspot.com/rest/users/us2
