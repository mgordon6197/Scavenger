Requests for the REST API
-------------------------
- can be executed using any REST Client, for example 
  - POSTMAN which is available in the Chrome App Store. Be aware to add the headers to the request!
  - CURL which is a unix standard command line tool and should be available on any Linux/Mac machine

Objectives
----------
OK - Retrieve all Objectives:
    curl -H "Accept: application/json" -X GET http://localhost:8080/rest/objectives

OK - Create a new Objective:
    curl -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST --data "{\"keyname\":\"hello\", \"title\":\"<title.yaay>\",\"info\":\"<info>\",\"latitude\":39.9769214975,\"longitude\":-110.185279856,\"owner\":\"<owner>\",\"otherConfirmedUsers\":\"<otherConfirmedUsers>\",\"isVisitedGPS\":null,\"isVisitedVisual\":null,\"activity\":\"photo\", \"image\": null, \"date\":1456348804531}" http://localhost:8080/rest/objectives

Users
-----
- Objective id's are stored with each user as a list. So each User data record doesn't contain the full dataset of the objective, but only the id.

- Retrieve all Data from User with id 'us2':
  curl -H "Accept: application/json" -X GET http://localhost:8080/rest/users/us2

OK - Create a new User with id 'us2':
    curl -v -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST --data "{\"userid\":\"us2\"}" http://localhost:8080/rest/users

OK - Add a Objective of Type 'visualObjective' to a User 'us2', provided the keyname of a existing objective:
    curl -H "Accept: application/json" -X POST --data "objectiveType=visualObjective&objectiveId=location101456300906241" http://http://localhost:8080/rest/users/us2
